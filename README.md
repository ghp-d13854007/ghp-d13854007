Dengue Research Methods Analysis

# What I Did  
I counted how many dengue cases were reported in 2014 based on weekly data from Taiwan CDC.

# Tools I Used  
- R  
- readr and dplyr packages  

# What I Found  
There were **15747** dengue cases in 2014.

# How To Run It  
1. In a single folder, I put the `dengue.csv` file and the R script (`DNGRM.R`).  
2. Then, opened `DNGRM.R` in RStudio and run it.  
3. I observed the case numbers  (mentioned above) in the console. 

# Note About the Data  
I didnâ€™t upload the actual data file (`dengue.csv`) to GitHub.
